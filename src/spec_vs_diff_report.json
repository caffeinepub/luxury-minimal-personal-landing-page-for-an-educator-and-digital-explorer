  "summary": "The diff updates HERO_PORTRAIT_PATH to point to a cropped headshot derivative, but there is insufficient evidence that the actual portrait asset was added/updated and REQ-26’s constraint that only heroPortrait.ts be updated is violated by additional modified files.",

      "reason": "The config path is updated to a cropped derivative filename, but the diff summary shows no added/updated image asset file, so it cannot be confirmed that the displayed hero portrait actually comes from the uploaded image rather than a missing/broken or pre-existing asset.",
